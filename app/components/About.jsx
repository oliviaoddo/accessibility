                <h2>A project by Olivia Oddo</h2>
                <p>The purpose of this project is to demonstrate simple ways in which a website can be made more accessible.</p>
                <h3>What is web accessibility?</h3>
                <p>The mission of W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative is to enable people with disabilities to participate equally on the World Wide Web. Websites and web technologies that are designed poorly can create barriers that exclude people from using the Web.</p>
                <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
                <p>It is important for the Web to be accessible in order to provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with diverse abilities. There are people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability who access the web. Some people use assistive technologies such as screen readers, screen magnifiers, voice recognition software, and selection switches, therefore it is important for these technologies to have adequate access to the web.</p>
